# Build a car and find its predicted price!

🚗 With this app, you can build your own car and find it's predicted price with the parameters you select.

🚘 This app is for people that are interested in how much a car would cost if built and bought in India.

🏎️ Predictive prices are predicted with a random forest regression model that is built with an r^2 of above 90%. With this high of an r^2, the price will be very close to what the car would actually cost.
