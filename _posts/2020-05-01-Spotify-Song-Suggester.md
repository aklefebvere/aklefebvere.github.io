subtitle: Suggesting Songs Using K-NN

- Over the course of a week, I worked with a cross-functional team consisting of: web developers, data engineers, and other data scientists to create a Spotify song recommendation system.

- Me and two other data scientists created a K-nearest neighbor model utilizing over 40,000 songs from Spotify using the parameters from each song that were extracted from the Spotify API
