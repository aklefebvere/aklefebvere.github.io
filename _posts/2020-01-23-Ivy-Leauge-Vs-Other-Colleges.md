One of the first things high school students think about is what college do they want to go to after high school. Should I strive for excellent grades and perfect ACT/SAT scores to get into an Ivy Leauge school? Should I get pretty good grades and just go for a college in my state? Is there really a big difference is students salarys that graduate from a Ivy Leauge school compared to any other school? This blog post answers these questions. I will be analyzing and visualizing this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries#salaries-by-college-type.csv) to compare the Ivy League salarys throughout a graduates career compared to other colleges in the United States.
