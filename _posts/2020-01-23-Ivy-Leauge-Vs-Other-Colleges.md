One of the first things high school students think about is what college do they want to go to after high school. Should I strive for excellent grades and perfect ACT/SAT scores to get into an Ivy Leauge school? Should I get pretty good grades and just go for a college in my state? Is there really a big difference is students salarys that graduate from a Ivy Leauge school compared to any other school? This blog post answers these questions. I will be analyzing and visualizing this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries#salaries-by-college-type.csv) to compare the Ivy League salarys throughout a graduates career compared to other colleges in the United States.

The dataset I will be working with consists of 269 schools all across the United States. Each school is categorized into five categories: Ivy Leauge, engineering, liberal arts, party (I'm not really sure how a school is considered a "party college"), and state. Each school contains the average mean salary throughout a graduates career (starting salary to mid-career 90 percentile ). 

The first thing I want to do is to compare the mean average salary for each salary category from each school type. I split the dataset into five different datasets that only have the data for each category of schools so I could find the mean of each salary category. I then created a grouped bar chart to visualize the mean for each salary category from each school type.
