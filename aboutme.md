title: About me
---

Hi! My name is Adriann and welcome to my portfolio website! I am a data scientist that has been endorsed by Lambda School in the data science track. At my time at Lambda School, I have have learned a multiude of data science skills such as:

- Data visualization
- Data Cleaning
- Building predictive models (machine learning)
- Data engineering
- building RESTful API's
- Application deployment

Outside of my data science career, I enjoy teaching marching band's and marching drum corps (professional marching band). I marched in my high school marching band for all four years and marched drum corps for three summers. I marched with the Colts Drum and Bugle Corps in 2017-2018 and marched with the Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps in 2019. I have tought marching band at the high school I marched for two years and leading the band to earn multiple awards at regional marching band competitions. My experience with high school marching band and teaching high school marching band have gave me great skills to utilize in the tech industry. Those experiences have gave me life-long skills such as: commitment, time-management, leadership, and communication skills. If it wasn't for marching band and drum corps, I wouldn't be writing this about me right now.

In my free time, I usually watch drum corps shows, practice more coding, or playing games on the computer with some friends. If you would like to know more about me, feel free to contact me with the links in the top right or at the bottom of the page. Thank you and I hope you enjoy exploring all the projects I have done in the past.
